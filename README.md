### Project Overview
Vehicle theft is a significant issue in New Zealand, impacting insurance costs, personal security, and community well-being. This project analyzes historical theft data to uncover actionable patterns that could help law enforcement, insurance companies, and vehicle owners develop more effective prevention strategies.

### Key Questions I Asked:

- When are vehicles most likely to be stolen?
- What types of vehicles are most targeted?
- Where are thefts concentrated?

### Data Sources and Methodology

**Primary Dataset:** Public dataset from Kaggle.

1. **Acquire & Clean**
   - Loaded multiple CSV files using Microsoft Excel
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicate values
   - Standardized data type for each column.
2. **Explore & Analyze**
   - Used Excel for calculations and aggregations
   - Performed time series analysis to identify seasonal patterns
   - Calculated key metrics: regional theft rates, thefts per vehicle type and car make
   - Created correlation matrices to examine relationships between variables
     
3. **Visualize & Communicate**
   - Built an interactive Excel dashboard for exploration
   - Developed a story narrative to guide viewers through key insights
   
### Tool Used

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization.

### Key Findings

1. **Common Family Cars Were Prime Targets:** 54% of thefts were station wagons, saloons, or hatchbacks.
2. **Luxury Cars Were Not the Primary Target:** Standard makes made up 96% of stolen vehicles.
3. Toyota was the most stolen car brand, leading all other makes by 15% in total theft volume.
4.  **Theft Activity Peaked in the First Quarter of the Year:** The first quarter (Jan–Mar) accounted for 56% of annual theft frequency, indicating a strong seasonal trend.
5. **Highest Risk Region:** The Bay of Plenty had the highest theft rate per capita, despite Auckland having the most total thefts.

### Recommendations

- Collaborate with manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda to assess and improve the security of their most-stolen models in New Zealand.
- Increase visible patrols and surveillance especially in high-theft regions (Bay of Plenty, Auckland) during the first quarter of the year.
- Scrap and parts dealers should be required to verify ownership and identification of vehicles before buying or selling car parts.
- Create a real-time alert system to notify repair shops, parts dealers, and ports the moment a high-theft vehicle is stolen.
- All new cars, especially the most-stolen models, should be required to have better built-in security.
