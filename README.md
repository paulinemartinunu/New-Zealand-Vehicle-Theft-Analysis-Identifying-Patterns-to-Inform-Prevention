### Project Overview
This analytical project aims to provide insight into vehicle theft incidents across New Zealand from October 2021 to April 2022. By examining key factors such as location and vehicle details, it seeks to identify patterns, geographical concentrations, and trends to enable informed prevention strategies and efficient resource allocation by law enforcement.
data sources and brief description of what the data contains

### Data Sources

Primary Dataset: The analysis was conducted using the "Motor+Vehicle+Thefts+CSV.rar" file, which contains records of motor vehicle thefts in New Zealand for a specified time period.

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization.

### Data Cleaning

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Removing duplicates.
4. Verifying data types for each column.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions such as:

- What month recorded the highest rate of theft?
- What vehicle make type had more theft occurence?
- What are the top stolen car make/brand?
- What regions have the most population and what are the theft rates?
- What vehicle types have the most theft rate?

### Results

1. Station wagons, saloons, and hatchbacks were the most stolen passenger vehicles, collectively accounting for over half of all thefts.
2. Standard makes comprised the overwhelming majority (96%) of thefts, with luxury makes representing a small fraction.
3. Toyota was the most stolen car brand by a significant margin.
4. Thefts peaked in March, with the first quarter of the year showing the highest overall frequency.
5. While Auckland had the most total thefts, the Bay of Plenty had the highest theft rate relative to its population.

### Recommendations

- Collaborate with manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda to assess and improve the security of their most-stolen models in New Zealand.
- Increase visible patrols and surveillance especially in high-theft regions (Bay of Plenty, Auckland) during the first quarter of the year.
- Scrap and parts dealers should be required to verify ownership and identification of vehicles before buying or selling car parts.
- Create a real-time alert system to notify repair shops, parts dealers, and ports the moment a high-theft vehicle is stolen.
- All new cars, especially the most-stolen models, should be required to have better built-in security.
